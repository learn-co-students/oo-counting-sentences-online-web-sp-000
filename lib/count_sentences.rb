#[^\.!?]:Caret inside of a character class [^ ] is the negation operator. Which means we are
#looking for characters which are not present in list: ., ! and ?.

# + :is a greedy operator that returns matches between 1 and unlimited times.
#(capturing our sentences here and ignoring repetitions like ...)



# [\.!?] : matching characters ., ! or ?.
#In a nutshell, we are capturing all characters that are
#not ., ! or ? till we get characters that are ., ! or ?. Which basically can be treated as a sentence (in broad senses).
